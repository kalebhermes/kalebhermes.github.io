# 4th Edition Magic Item Block Generator

The 4th Edition of Dungeons & Dragons was the first edition that I ever played. Because of the nostalgia I feel for that time, I collect 4th Edition books, for the simple joy and perusing the art and looking at them on my shelf. 

Matthew Perkins released [this video entitled Crime Club #1] a few years ago now, in which he highlights neat things that can be stolen from the 4th Edition Player's Handbook. That video, in addition to Matt Colville's [4th Edition monster video] gave me the idea for a blog dedicated to converting monsters and magic items from 4th Edition into things useable in your 5th Edition game. 

That blog doesn't exist, and probably never will. That being said, one of the things I always knew was a prerequisite for the blog was the ability to properly represent the original stat blocks for monsters and magic items in an HTML format. That's what this tool is for. 

Heavily inspired by [omnichron]'s monster stat block generator, this is my first iteration of a "Magic Item" block generator.
